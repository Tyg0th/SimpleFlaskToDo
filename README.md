# Hello everyone!

## This is my first Flask Repository with a Simple To-Do application

I used Bootstrap for templates, SQLite in the database and WTForms to create the forms

## Init app

Just run ```**pip install -r requirements.txt**```.

Then set the environment variables (for Windows) `**set FLASK_APP=flaskapp**` and finally `**flask run**`

## Enjoy!
